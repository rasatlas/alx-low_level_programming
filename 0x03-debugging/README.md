0x03. C - Debugging

1. Task 0 Multiple Mains - create a file named 0-main.c. This file must test that the function positive_or_negative() gives the correct output when given a case of 0.

2. Task 1 Like, comment, subscribe - Copy this main file. Comment out (donâ€™t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.

3. Task 2 0 > 972? - this program prints the largest of three integers. Fix the code so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case.
