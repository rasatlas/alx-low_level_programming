- No more than 5 functions per file
- You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, etcâ€¦ is forbidden

Task 0. 0-puts_recursion.c - a function that prints a string, followed by a new line.

Task 1. 1-print_rev_recursion.c - a function that prints a string in reverse.

Task 2. 2-strlen_recursion.c - a function that returns the length of a string.

Task 3. 3-factorial.c - a function that returns the factorial of a given number. If n is lower than 0, the function should return -1 to indicate an error

Task 4. 4-pow_recursion.c - a function that returns the value of x raised to the power of y. If y is lower than 0, the function should return -1

Task 5. 5-sqrt_recursion.c - a function that returns the natural square root of a number. If n does not have a natural square root, the function should return -1.

Task 6. 6-is_prime_number.c - a function that returns 1 if the input integer is a prime number, otherwise return 0.

Task 7. 100-is_palindrome.c - a function that returns 1 if a string is a palindrome and 0 if not. An empty string is a palindrome

Task 8. 101-wildcmp.c - a function that compares two strings and returns 1 if the strings can be considered identical, otherwise return 0. s2 can contain the special character *. The special char * can replace any string (including an empty string)
